# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding 
`Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description: Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline | Incomplete
|Day 2| Website Layout and Responsive Web Design Layout (HTML/CSS) | Incomplete
|Day 3| Website Styling and Javascript | Incomplete
|Day 4| MVP & Bug Fixes | Incomplete
|Day 5| Final Touches & Present | Incomplete

## Project Description

My final project will be a responsive website with a mobile first design approach containing content such as my past projects, a brief explanation about me, my skills, a method to connect, and contact information. This will incorporate the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and JSON. The goal is to make the website as dynamic as possible using CSS layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid while also trying to provide opportunities for user interactivity.

## Portfolio I want to Emulate

Search and compare at least 3 profile web sites.  Record your findings in the table below and include some aspect of the site that you would like to incorporate into your own site.

Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [lianapenn.com](https://www.lianapenn.com/) | Ability to interact with the background image on the home screen |
| [samcasey.info](https://samcasey.info/) | Footer with navigation buttons back to certain sections of the page |
| [eloise-ress-barrow.surge.sh](http://eloise-ress-barrow.surge.sh/#writing) | Layout of the projects |

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

[Link](https://i.imgur.com/FtDdLwq.jpg)

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matrix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's priority is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Website layout with Bootstrap
- Interactive navigation bar
- Mobile/Desktop responsive design
- Adding formspree for contact info
- Setup portfolio projects on JSON
- Add projects with JQuery
- Add CSS styling to elements
- Footer navigation bar with quick links
- Setup skills section with icon images

#### PostMVP 

- Hover effects on projects
- Carousel effect on project section
- Mouse over effects on titles/headers

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evaluate game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Website layout with Bootstrap | H | 3hr | hr |
| Interactive navigation bar | H | 2hr | hr |
| Mobile/Desktop responsive design | H | 2hr | hr |  
| Adding formspree for contact info | H | 3hr|  hr | 
| Setup portfolio projects on JSON | H | 2hr | hr|
| Add projects with JQuery | H | 2hr|  hr | 
| Add CSS styling to elements | L | 3hr | hr | hr |
| Footer navigation bar with quick links| L | 2hr |  hr |
| Setup skills section with icon images | H | 2hr|  hr | 
| Total | H | 21hrs| hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Hover effects on projects | L | 2hr | hr |
| Carousel effect on project section| L | 3hr | hr |
| Mouse over effects on titles/headers| L | 3hr | hr |
| Total | H | 8hrs| hrs |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and their role in the project. 

## Code Snippet
Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  
```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
